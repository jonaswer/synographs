# SYNOGRAPHS

Context:

Language sometimes offers different words for the same meaning. This is widely known as synonyms. Furthermore, there are words, which can be used for different meanings depending on the context the speaker uses them. This Python code builds a graph with synonym sets as vertices and connects vertices including one or more same words with edges. A shortest path algorithm (dijekstra implemented) can be used to find the shortest path from one word to another with the help of their individual synonyms. A small picture shall help to understand the idea.

Deployment:

The code is deployed web-based under synographs.herokuapp.com
